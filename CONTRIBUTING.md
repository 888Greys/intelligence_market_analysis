## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** rules (when configured)
- Use **async/await** instead of callbacks
- Prefer **const** over **let**, avoid **var**
- Use **meaningful variable names**

```typescript
// Good
const marketTrendsData = await fetchMarketData(topic);

// Bad
const d = await fetchMarketData(topic);
```

### CSS/HTML

- Use **semantic HTML elements**
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layouts
- Maintain **consistent spacing** (multiples of 4px/8px)

### API Design

- Use **RESTful** conventions
- Provide **clear error messages**
- Include **proper HTTP status codes**
- Document **all endpoints**

## üá∞üá™ Kenya Market Focus

When contributing, please consider:

### Target Audience
- **Kenyan businesses** and entrepreneurs
- **East African investors**
- **International companies** entering Kenya
- **Government agencies** and NGOs
- **Academic researchers**

### Market Priorities
1. **Fintech** (M-Pesa, digital lending, crypto)
2. **Agriculture** (AgriTech, supply chain)
3. **Energy** (Solar, mini-grids, clean energy)
4. **E-commerce** (Local vs international platforms)
5. **Healthcare** (Telemedicine, digital health)

### Data Sources
- Prioritize **Kenyan government** sources (CBK, KNBS)
- Include **regional organizations** (EAC, African Development Bank)
- Reference **local companies** (Safaricom, Equity Bank)
- Consider **mobile-first** user experience

## üîß Technical Contributions

### Adding New Research Categories

1. **Update frontend** (`public/index.html`)
   ```html
   <button class="category-btn" data-topic="your-research-topic">
       üî∏ Your Category Name
   </button>
   ```

2. **Add fallback sources** (`server.ts`)
   ```typescript
   if (topic.toLowerCase().includes('your-keyword')) {
     return [
       {
         title: "Relevant Kenyan Source",
         url: "https://example.co.ke/report",
         description: "Description of the source",
         date: baseDate
       }
     ];
   }
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly** with real API calls

### Improving Mobile Experience

- Test on **actual mobile devices** (not just browser dev tools)
- Ensure **touch targets** are at least 44px
- Optimize **loading performance** on slow networks
- Consider **offline functionality** for poor connectivity

### Enhancing AI Research

- Improve **prompt engineering** for better results
- Add **data validation** with Zod schemas
- Implement **caching** for repeated queries
- Add **rate limiting** for API calls
